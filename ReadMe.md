## 1. Introduction

Optimizing application performance is a critical aspect of developing web applications. Users expect applications to load quickly and respond to their interactions smoothly.

Internally, React uses several techniques to minimize the number of costly DOM operations required to update the UI. We are guaranteed a very fast UI by default. However as the application grows there are ways where we can still speed up the application with various performance optimization techniques, significantly enhancing the user experience by reducing load times and improving responsivenes.
